# bacharach

Tools to Work with the Raindrop API

## Description

Raindrop <https://raindrop.io> provides a URL bookmarking service and an
API for working with that service and more. Tools are provided to work
with the Raindrop API. A Raindrop API key (free) is required.

## Whatâ€™s Inside The Tin

The following functions are implemented:

- `get_collection`: Get a collection
- `get_raindrop_permacopy`: Get a single raindrop permacopy from the
  cache (Pro feature)
- `get_raindrop`: Get a single raindrop
- `get_raindrops`: Get all raindrops from a collection (TODO pagination)
- `get_user`: Get currently authenticated user details
- `raindrop_api_token`: Get or set RAINDROP_API_TOKEN value
- `raindrop_parse_url`: Parse and extract useful info from any URL

NOTE: This is a woefully incomplete wrapper (so far). You are def
encouraged to contribute if you use Raindrop and the package will be a
full wrapper. This skeleton was made to remind myself to make this
package and have something to hack on during long-running Athena queries
or tedious conference calls.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/bacharach")
```

NOTE: To use the â€˜remotesâ€™ install options you will need to have the
[{remotes} package](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) installed.

## Usage

``` r
library(bacharach)

# current version
packageVersion("bacharach")
## [1] '0.1.1'
```
